                Our project is going to design a travelling website serving as an information platform for people who are interested in travel. Here, you can search the travel information you want as well as share your own travel experience! We are focusing on most of the famous tourist cities in China and provide information including city introductions, scenic spot manuals, gourmet food recommendations, etc. In a word, we are aimed to cover the information that users may be interested in as much as possible. Note: In order to simplify this project, the target travel country is now limited to China.
